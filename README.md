### Problems encountered by most common to rarest

```
Bed not level
Nozzle getting filled by plastic because of heath
Temperature too high (had to change when changing the brand of PLA filament)
Retraction causing the filament to get flat because of the wheels pressure
```

#### Happened only once and fixed

```
Base layer print speed too high
Bowden tube was not supporting heath well and collapsing on itself
Fan stuck on 'off mode'
```

### Filament brand

Best to worst by order (I'm only strating to test more filament brands)

```
Ultrafuse > Real Filament
```

More to come like ths dotfiles, window manager used, the eInk display config and the hardware list
